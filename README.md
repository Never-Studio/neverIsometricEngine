# neverIsometricEngine
An isometric engine for pixel games. It is currently under development and not fully published, so this repo is still empty.
You can visit the [docs](https://www.neverstudio.de/neverisometric.html) to see the features it will have (and to get started with the beta version).
A preview of the code is avialable [here](https://www.neverstudio.de/isometricEngine.js).
Note that we do not grant you any rights as of now. You are not to redistribute the code or any derivative work.
You may share the link, if you explicitly and unmistakingly state that this is the code of the "NeverIsometricEngine" from "neverstudio.de" and append a copy of the license requirements.
