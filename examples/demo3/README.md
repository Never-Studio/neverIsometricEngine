# neverIsometricEngine
This is an example that showcases the layering events.
The boxes move randomly, change color upon collision and due to a change to the engine they have solid colorful bounding boxes.
See the comments in the file and the [documentation](https://www.neverstudio.de/neverisometric.html) for explanations.
You can open demo3.html in a browser to see the result.
The code is very similar to demo2.html in demo1_2 except for the change in the engine and the controllable player box that is added in line 62 to 68.
